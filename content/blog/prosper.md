*Prosper* is here to help you get into that rich bitch mindset. The first step toward living a life of abundance is *feeling* prosperous. Large leaps first require smaller movements. Let this bath be one of those small steps towards living a more comfortable life in the flow of prosperity. Tell the universe you deserve this success, then **claim it** by hopping into the bath and imagining yourself soaking in all your blessings! 

Say it with me! **I am worthy of love and success**. My life is **infinitely blessed**! I receive the **flow of abundance** with **open arms**, and lovingly pay it forward. **I gleefully share my blessings** with those I love and those who are in need!

This is a coffee and oat based bath, with no use of strong smelling essential oils. The coffee grounds your intention into physical reality and gives the bath a little extra punch. The oats were chosen to counteract the coffee's abrasiveness as well as for their association with wealth. A blend of additional ingredients such as honey suckle, basil, and irish moss were carefully selected to help you attract good fortune and thrive. Sometimes it can be as simple as dedicating 30 minutes to yourself, taking a steamy hot bath, and allowing nature's gifts to work their magic on you!

* Do not use if pregnant. 
* All our bath soaks are vegan, all natural, and cruelty free.
