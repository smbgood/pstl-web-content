Honestly, who doesn't love aliens and space? I created this bath with the idea of meditating so hard you blast off into outer space. If this has never happened for you before, this bath may just be your ticket there! Sometimes it can be a real struggle to quiet the mind and reach those deep inner layers we seek connection with. *Out of this World* is here to help you solve that problem!

This is a heavily scented bath. Its key notes of frankincense, vanilla, and peppermint blend into a heady aroma meant to help encourage meditative states. *Out of this World* is well suited for before heavy mediation sessions, or if you're like me, you can turn the bath itself into a meditation! Water is an excellent conduit for energy and is also distinctly connected to our emotions. So step into this steamy *Out of this World* bath, and allow your personal magic to meld with that of the bath. Then hop out (not literally, please don't hurt yourself) as a more thoughtful and intuitive version of yourself.

* Do not use if pregnant.
* All our bath soaks are vegan, all natural, and cruelty free.
* Please contact me for any questions or allergy concerns!
