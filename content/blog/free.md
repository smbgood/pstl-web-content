This bath earned its name *Free* for the feelings it evokes. Even if you feel as if you are a moosh of caterpillar 'stuck' inside your cocoon, know you are soon going to burst forth as the most gorgeous butterfly you could possibly imagine! The purpose of this bath is to help cleanse lingering blockages and open the mind/body/soul to higher frequencies and beliefs. Initially I made this bath for myself to help overcome a few cycles that kept popping back up. No matter how much I *felt* I was done working through them, it became evident I needed a little more help. Water is an excellent conduit of energy! The elemental base makes it easy to embrace the purpose of this bath, and allow the water to cleanse you of all that clings to your soul. Drain the tub and imagine all that hindered you washing away to be returned to the Earth and recycled anew.

*Free* is a citrus scented bath with coffee and dead sea salt serving as its primary base. It might sound like there's a lot going on with this one, but that's because there is (and P.s **you're worth it!)**. There is no reason to walk through life carrying every outdated cycle or belief that's ever affected us, allowing it to weigh us down as a heavy shroud of shame, guilt, anger, etc.... If you've been doing the work and trying to better yourself & your life and struggling to see the results, then why not treat yourself a little and see if maybe something changes?
