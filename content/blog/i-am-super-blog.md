One day I went down by the river and thought to myself -- have I ever really written a blog? Like sat down and tried to write one? I guess, maybe not. It's a sad thought, not to have ever blogged in one's life. With a little effort, and some classic ingenuity, anyone can get down to work and write about a topic that they really care about.
